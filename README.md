Clojure data inspector

##  Differences to clojure.inspector

- The visual representation looks like EDN
- Shows indexes
- Shows laziness
- Limited realization of lazy sequences and ability to scroll through
  them and/or show a larger portion of them.
- You can select things at any level
- Better keyboard support
- You can navigate data structures used as keys
- def the highlighted data for further processing in the REPL.

## Usage

### Keyboard

* <kbd>up</kbd> Move up one element or select parent structure if
  you're at the top.
* <kbd>down</kbd> Move down one element.
* <kbd>right</kbd> Move one element to the right.
* <kbd>left</kbd> Move one element to the left. Move to the first
  element of the sequence. If you are at the first element, select
  parent structure.
* <kbd>TAB</kbd> Expand/collapse data structure.
* <kbd>ENTER</kbd> Go into a data structure.
* <kbd>.</kbd> "Scroll" down the selected sequence by one element. If
  the sequence is lazy, this realizes additional
  elements. <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> scrolls by 10 elements.
* <kbd>,</kbd> "Scroll" up the selected sequence by one
  element. <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> scrolls by 10 elements.
* <kbd>=</kbd> Show more. Expands the window of shown elements in the
  sequence by 1 element.
* <kbd>-</kbd> Show less. Contracts the window of shown elements in
  the sequence by 1 element.
* <kbd>alt/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>=</kbd> Zoom in.
* <kbd>alt/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> Zoom out.
* <kbd>alt/cmd</kbd> + <kbd>0</kbd> Reset zoom.
* <kbd>t</kbd> Table view. If a sequence of maps is selected, they
  will presented in a tabular format. Press <kbd>t</kbd> again to
  switch back to the normal view.
* <kbd>i</kbd> Toggle sequence index visibility.
* <kbd>d</kbd> `def` the selected part of the data as the `trinket/x`
  var.
* <kbd>u</kbd> Unmark.

## TODO

- [x] Make closing brace align with the bottom of the last item (see
      what happens if you expand the last item)
- [x] Take into account expansion state when doing layout (see what
      happens when you expand a key that is a map)
- [x] Place cursor at root of data when starting
- [ ] Realize lazy seqs in the background
- [ ] Scroll to follow cursor
- [x] Don't draw outside visible area
- [x] BUG: clicking breaks view has been scaled
- [x] BUG: click to select tables
- [x] Table view
- [x] Table view styling
- [x] BUG: white background when zooming out
- [ ] Table view navigation
- [ ] Customisable keys
- [ ] Customisable themes
- [ ] Move drop/take code for paging lazy sequences out of drawing
      code and into the event loop. This will allow us to constrain
      scrolling to not go beyond the end of the sequence. Also,
      drawing code should be very lightweight.
- [x] Improve rendering/scrolling speed for large data structures
      (especially noticable with tables)
- [x] Shorten namespaced keys in tables by defining (and displaying)
      ad-hoc unique aliases
- [ ] Status area information on focused structure such as element
      count
- [ ] Paging for non-lazy structures
- [ ] Turn keyword namespaces on and off
- [ ] Sorting
- [ ] BUG: can't go to parent of single-element sequence
- [ ] Apply spec to data structure and render problematic
      sub-structures/values
- [ ] datafy/nav
- [ ] view cljs data structures
- [ ] barchart
- [ ] show aliases on mixed single maps
- [ ] turn aliases on and off
- [x] BUG: broken scrolling in lazy data structures
- [x] BUG: keywords can be "expanded"
- [ ] BUG: Top-level empty maps render as invisible
- [x] BUG: Can't expand `{:a (range 100)}`
- [x] BUG: Can't go left from an expanded map, up to a lazy seq
- [ ] BUG: <d> doesn't work as expected in table cells
- [x] BUG: navigation doesn't work in expanded table cells
- [x] BUG: component attributes and options are complected
- [x] BUG: expand first map in collection of maps and start scrolling,
      see what happens.
- [x] BUG: <d> ignores offset
- [ ] reinstate grid padding
- [x] BUG: table headers don't use aliases

## REPL workflows

- Highlight something and press `d` to def it and then use it in the
  REPL. [DONE!]

- "mark" elements of the current seq according to whether they match a
  predicate or not. Implicit arguments are the inspector (default is
  the last one opened) and the path to mark, but you should be given
  the option to pass them. [DONE!]

- show/hide columns of tables

- use highlighted thing as implicit argument to your own function

## How to address both keys and values in nested data structures

``` clojure
> (s/def ::a (s/map-of keyword? ::b))
> (s/def ::b (s/map-of keyword? (s/coll-of int?)))

> (s/explain ::a {:xx {"sss" [1 2 "foo" 4]}})
In: [:xx 1 "sss" 0] val: "sss" fails spec: :trinket.inspector/b at: [1 0] predicate: keyword?
In: [:xx 1 "sss" 1 2] val: "foo" fails spec: :trinket.inspector/b at: [1 1] predicate: int?

> (s/explain ::a {:xx ""})
In: [:xx 1] val: "" fails spec: :trinket.inspector/b at: [1] predicate: map?

> (s/explain ::a {"wrong" {:foo [1 2 3]}})
In: ["wrong" 0] val: "wrong" fails spec: :trinket.inspector/a at: [0] predicate: keyword?
```
