Clojure data inspector

##  Differences to clojure.inspector

- The visual representation looks like EDN
- Shows indexes
- Shows laziness
- Limited realization of lazy sequences and ability to scroll through
  them and/or show a larger portion of them.
- You can select things at any level
- Better keyboard support
- You can navigate data structures used as keys

## TODO

- [x] Make closing brace align with the bottom of the last item (see
      what happens if you expand the last item)
- [x] Take into account expansion state when doing layout (see what
      happens when you expand a key that is a map)
- [x] Place cursor at root of data when starting
- [ ] Realize lazy seqs in the background
- [ ] Scroll to follow cursor
- [ ] Don't draw outside visible area
- [x] BUG: clicking breaks view has been scaled
- [x] BUG: click to select tables
- [x] Table view
- [x] Table view styling
- [ ] Table view navigation
- [ ] Customisable keys
- [ ] Move drop/take code for paging lazy sequences out of drawing
      code and into the event loop. This will allow us to constrain
      scrolling to not go beyond the end of the sequence. Also,
      drawing code should be very lightweight.

## How to address both keys and values in nested data structures

``` clojure
> (s/def ::a (s/map-of keyword? ::b))
> (s/def ::b (s/map-of keyword? (s/coll-of int?)))

> (s/explain ::a {:xx {"sss" [1 2 "foo" 4]}})
In: [:xx 1 "sss" 0] val: "sss" fails spec: :trinket.inspector/b at: [1 0] predicate: keyword?
In: [:xx 1 "sss" 1 2] val: "foo" fails spec: :trinket.inspector/b at: [1 1] predicate: int?

> (s/explain ::a {:xx ""})
In: [:xx 1] val: "" fails spec: :trinket.inspector/b at: [1] predicate: map?

> (s/explain ::a {"wrong" {:foo [1 2 3]}})
In: ["wrong" 0] val: "wrong" fails spec: :trinket.inspector/a at: [0] predicate: keyword?
```
